# CS546-Final-Project

Attila Calendar is a general-purpose calendar application that allows users to schedule and manage their own events. The user may get a general overview of their workflow by viewing the simple and interactive calendar GUI on the main page. A finer and more comprehensive view of the userâ€™s events can be achieved through accessing the events page.

## Setup & Running
1. Install the required dependencies.  
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Seed the database. Before running this, make sure to have MongoDB running in the background. See [MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/) for more specifics.
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```
3. Start the web application.
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Open in http://localhost:3000
